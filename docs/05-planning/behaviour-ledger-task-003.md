# Behaviour Ledger — REVREM-TASK-003

This file is the instrument behind **Contract C3** of `REVREM-TASK-003`. The
golden-master suite (Wave A2) detects every diff in observable output; each
diff must resolve to exactly one of:

- **(a) an intended change** — recorded as an entry below, *before* the
  snapshot is updated; or
- **(b) a CI failure** — an unintended regression, fixed rather than ledgered.

There is no silent third option.

## What must be ledgered

- **Machine contract** (migration-gated): JSON summary shape, `events.jsonl`
  schema/content, exit codes. Any change requires a `schema_version` bump, a
  `CHANGELOG.md` entry, and an entry here.
- **Human presentation** (unconstrained, logged for traceability only):
  terminal text, progress rendering, cosmetic ordering. Entry here is optional
  but encouraged when a change is large enough to surprise a reader.

## Entry format

```
### YYYY-MM-DD — <short title> (<wave/PR>)

- **Contract:** machine | human
- **What changed:** <observable difference>
- **Why:** <reason>
- **Before / After:** <snippet or snapshot ref>
- **schema_version impact:** <none | bumped X -> Y> (machine only)
- **CHANGELOG:** <link/anchor> (machine only)
```

## Entries

### 2026-05-22 — A2b loop-path golden masters (Wave A2b)

- **Contract:** machine (additional baseline captures, no behaviour change)
- **What changed:** nothing in production code. Pinned the three remaining
  **loop terminations** using the A2a machinery:
  `loop_findings_summary.json` / `loop_findings_events.json`
  (findings remain, iterations exhausted — `stopped_reason=max_iterations_reached`,
  `final_status=unknown`), `loop_budget_summary.json` / `loop_budget_events.json`
  (token-budget ceiling — `stopped_reason=budget_ceiling_hit`,
  `error="tokens budget reached: 100 >= 10"`, with `cost_charge`/`cost_ceiling_hit`
  events), and `loop_cancel_summary.json` / `loop_cancel_events.json`
  (operator `KeyboardInterrupt` — `stopped_reason=cancelled`,
  `error="cancelled by operator"`, `diagnostics.json` + `cancellation` event).
- **Test-support change (not production):** `tests/support/fakes.py` `FakeRunner`
  now raises a mapped value when it is a `BaseException` (returns it otherwise),
  so the cancel path is drivable through `run_loop(config, runner, …)`.
- **Why:** complete the loop half of the C3 change-detector so B2/B3 cannot
  silently alter the failure/exhaustion machine contract.
- **Before / After:** baseline; these snapshots are now authoritative alongside
  the A2a clear-path pair.
- **Normalizer scope:** unchanged from A2a (run-dir paths → `<RUN_DIR>`,
  `wall_elapsed_seconds` → `<DURATION>`). No git-SHA / byte-size placeholders
  were needed — the loop fixture runs in a non-git tmp dir (`git_state.available`
  = false, all SHAs null) and no path emits a byte size. Those placeholders
  remain deferred to A2c with their first real consumer.
- **Scope note:** per-subcommand snapshots were **split out of A2b into a new
  A2c** (plan amended in this commit). Rationale: a subcommand's result is its
  own `CommandOutcome` ADT (C5), a different output shape from the loop's
  `RunOutcome`; pinning them belongs after C1/C5 stabilise those types.
- **schema_version impact:** none.

### 2026-05-21 — A2a golden-master baseline (Wave A2a)

- **Contract:** machine (baseline capture, no behaviour change)
- **What changed:** nothing in production code. Added the golden-master
  machinery (`tests/support/{fakes,normalize,snapshot}.py`, `tests/conftest.py`)
  and committed the first pinned machine-contract snapshots for the loop
  **review-clear** path: `tests/snapshots/loop_clear_summary.json` and
  `loop_clear_events.json`.
- **Why:** establish the change-detector (C3) so later waves cannot silently
  alter the machine contract.
- **Before / After:** baseline; these snapshots are now authoritative. Any
  future diff is either a ledgered intentional change (regenerate with
  `REVREM_UPDATE_SNAPSHOTS=1`) or a CI failure.
- **Normalizer scope:** run-dir paths → `<RUN_DIR>`, `wall_elapsed_seconds` →
  `<DURATION>` (the budget wall-time carve-out from the A1 entry). git-SHA and
  byte-size placeholders are deferred to A2b (null / stable on this path).
- **schema_version impact:** none.

### 2026-05-21 — A1 Clock + RunIdentity seam (Wave A1)

- **Contract:** machine
- **What changed:** nothing observable. The loop now reads wall/monotonic time
  via an injected `Clock` and run-scoped ids via an injected `RunIdentity`
  (`clock.py`, `identity.py`), threaded as keyword args through `run_loop` /
  `_run_loop` / `write_summary` / `add_summary_contract_fields` /
  `default_artifact_dir`, and `events.JsonlSink` stamps `Event.ts` from its
  injected clock. **Defaults are the real clock / real `uuid4`, so production
  output is byte-for-byte identical.** Determinism only appears when a fake is
  injected (tests).
- **Why:** remove the #1 nondeterminism source so the A2 golden-master suite
  can pin the machine contract (C6).
- **Before / After:** identical for real runs; `tests/test_clock_identity_seam.py`
  demonstrates that a fake clock/identity makes `run_id`, `started_at`,
  `finished_at`, every `events.jsonl` `ts`, and the default artifact-dir suffix
  deterministic.
- **schema_version impact:** none.
- **Carve-out recorded for A2:** budget wall-time fields
  (`summary["wall_elapsed_seconds"]` and the `budgets` elapsed) are **not**
  injected in A1 — they stay on the real monotonic clock and must be
  **normalized by the A2 comparator**. Rationale: injecting them would require
  threading a clock through the budget read helpers, expanding A1's blast
  radius for no machine-contract benefit (the fields are measured durations
  that snapshots normalize regardless). The real-time-sensitive sites
  (double-Ctrl-C debounce, subprocess timeout deadlines) and human-display
  timestamps stay real by design, annotated `# det-exempt:` and enforced by
  `tests/test_determinism_gate.py`.
